# Adam Aguilera Personal Website

My personal website built with pure HTML and CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to be deployed on GitHub Pages and requires no build step or dependencies.

## Local Preview

To view the website locally:

1. Open the `src/index.html` file directly in your web browser.
   - Or, for best results (especially with images), run a simple local server:

   ```sh
   cd src
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

2. Visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.
