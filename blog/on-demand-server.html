            </h1>
            <div class="date">September 15, 2024</div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>As gamers, the allure of a persistent, shared world with friends is undeniable. But when it comes to
                    hosting, striking the right balance between availability, performance, cost, and ease of management
                    can be a surprisingly tricky endeavor.</p>

                <p>Let's dissect why common solutions often miss the mark and then dive into a more robust, cloud-native
                    approach.</p>

                <h2>The Pitfalls of Common Minecraft Server Hosting Solutions</h2>

                <h3>1. Self-Hosting: The Lure of Free, the Reality of Frustration</h3>
                <p>The most immediate thought for many is to self-host on a personal computer or even a Raspberry Pi.
                    The initial appeal is obvious: it's "free." However, this seemingly simple approach quickly unravels
                    when faced with the realities of long-term hosting:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Unreliable Availability:</strong> Leaving a personal computer online 24/7 is not only
                        inefficient but also prone to interruptions. After a few weeks of daily play, interest may wane,
                        and the host's machine will inevitably be shut down. Months later, reviving the server requires
                        direct intervention from the original host, creating friction for spontaneous play sessions.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Subpar Performance:</strong> While a high-end gaming PC might offer decent performance,
                        the friction of running a server in the background often leads to using older, less powerful
                        laptops. This sacrifices server performance, leading to lag and a less enjoyable experience for
                        players.</li>
                    <li><strong>Geographical Latency:</strong> If the host is on the East or West Coast, friends on the
                        opposite side of the country will experience significantly higher latency compared to a cloud
                        host strategically placed in the Midwest.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Third-Party Hosting and Minecraft Realms: Convenience at a Premium</h3>
                <p>Dedicated Minecraft hosting providers and Minecraft Realms offer excellent availability and generally
                    good performance. They handle the technical complexities, allowing you to focus on playing. However,
                    their primary drawback is cost:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fixed Monthly Fees:</strong> These services typically charge a fixed monthly fee,
                        regardless of actual server usage. If your friends are inactive for a month, you're still paying
                        the same amount. Ideally, cost should scale directly with usage to maximize value.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Designing a Smarter AWS Solution: The Cost-Effective, On-Demand Minecraft Server</h2>
                <p>Given the limitations of the above, I sought to leverage the power and flexibility of AWS to build a
                    Minecraft server solution that prioritizes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Maximizing Availability: Friends can access the server whenever they want.</li>
                    <li>Minimizing Costs: Pay only for what you use, as much as possible.</li>
                    <li>Good Server Performance: A smooth and enjoyable gameplay experience.</li>
                    <li>Minimal Manual Management and Maintenance: Automate as much as possible.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Our solution hinges on the ability to dynamically manage an EC2 instance, turning it on and off based
                    on demand, and ensuring seamless access for players.</p>

                <h3>The Core Concept: EC2 with Usage-Based Billing</h3>
                <p>At its heart, our server runs on an AWS EC2 instance. The key to cost optimization here lies in
                    understanding how EC2 instances are billed: you are not charged for a stopped EC2 instance. This
                    means we can configure the server to shut down when not in use, drastically reducing costs compared
                    to a continuously running instance.</p>

                <p>To achieve this, we implement a simple yet effective mechanism:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Inactivity Detection and Shutdown:</strong> We configure CloudWatch alarms on the EC2
                        instance to monitor network activity. If no network packets are detected for a defined period
                        (e.g., 30 minutes), the alarm triggers an action to stop the EC2 instance. This directly links
                        our costs to actual server usage.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Challenge of Access: On-Demand Power-Up</h3>
                <p>A stopped server is, by definition, offline. The real trick is letting my friends power it on
                    themselves without needing AWS console access.</p>

                <h4>1. The Serverless "On" Switch: AWS Lambda</h4>
                <p>A very simple Lambda function that tells AWS to start my specific EC2 instance when triggered.</p>

                <h4>2. User-Friendly Activation: Discord Slash Commands</h4>
                <p>Getting my friends to trigger this Lambda function is where Discord comes in. We all belong to the
                    same private discord server which solves both security and accessibility quite well. Historically,
                    Discord bots needed a server running 24/7, which goes against my goal of minimizing costs.
                    Thankfully, Discord's Slash Commands changed everything.</p>

                <p>Instead of hosting a bot, we can register a slash command (like /start-minecraft) directly with
                    Discord's API. When a friend types this command in our Discord channel, Discord sends a secure
                    request (a webhook) to an Amazon API Gateway endpoint. This API Gateway acts as a secure front door,
                    receiving the Discord request and passing it to my Lambda function. My Lambda then processes the
                    command, starts the EC2 instance, and can even send a confirmation message back to Discord.</p>

                <p>This setup means my "bot" is incredibly lean and only costs me for the few milliseconds it takes to
                    process a request and start the server. There's no idle server racking up charges.</p>

                <p>For a deeper dive into setting up a Discord bot with AWS Lambda and API Gateway for slash commands,
                    this <a href="https://github.com/ker0olos/aws-lambda-discord-bot" target="_blank">readme</a> is a
                    great resource.</p>

                <h3>The IPv4 Problem and the IPv6 Solution</h3>
                <p>This brings us to a crucial hurdle: IP addresses. When an EC2 instance is stopped and then restarted,
                    it typically receives a new public IPv4 address. This means players would constantly have to update
                    their Minecraft client with the new server IP, which is a major usability pain point.</p>

                <h4>The Elastic IP (IPv4) Conundrum</h4>
                <p>AWS offers Elastic IPs (EIPs) for IPv4, which are static public IP addresses that can be associated
                    with an EC2 instance. This seems like the perfect solution. However, there's a catch: Elastic IP
                    addresses for IPv4 incur a static fee if they are not associated with a running EC2 instance. Due to
                    the limited global supply of IPv4 addresses, AWS charges for unused EIPs to encourage efficient
                    allocation. This goes against our "minimize costs" goal if the server is frequently stopped.</p>

                <h4>The IPv6 Advantage: Free Static IPs</h4>
                <p>This is where IPv6 comes to the rescue! Unlike IPv4, which is nearing exhaustion, IPv6 offers an
                    astronomically larger address space. This abundance means that AWS does not charge for Elastic IP
                    addresses for IPv6, regardless of whether they are associated with a running instance.</p>

                <p>To leverage this, we configure our AWS network gateway and EC2 instance to support IPv6. Here's a
                    simplified explanation of how it works:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>VPC with IPv6 CIDR:</strong> Your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) needs to have an
                        associated IPv6 CIDR block.</li>
                    <li><strong>Subnet with IPv6 CIDR:</strong> The subnet where your EC2 instance resides also needs an
                        IPv6 CIDR block.</li>
                    <li><strong>EC2 Instance IPv6 Address:</strong> When you launch your EC2 instance, you assign it an
                        IPv6 address from the subnet's range. This IPv6 address remains static for the instance, even
                        when it's stopped and started.</li>
                    <li><strong>Internet Gateway for IPv6:</strong> Ensure your VPC has an Internet Gateway configured
                        to route IPv6 traffic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Security Group Rules:</strong> Configure your EC2 instance's security group to allow
                        incoming traffic on the Minecraft server's port (default 25565) over IPv6.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>By utilizing IPv6, our Minecraft server retains a constant, static IP address that friends can save
                    in their game, eliminating the need to update it every time the server starts. This provides a
                    seamless and reliable experience while keeping costs in check.</p>

                <h2>The Result: A Lean, Mean, Minecraft Machine</h2>
                <p>This architecture provides a powerful blend of features:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>High Availability:</strong> Friends can start the server whenever they want, ensuring
                        it's available when they're ready to play.</li>
                    <li><strong>Minimal Costs:</strong> We only pay for the EC2 instance compute time when the server is
                        actually in use, and there are no ongoing EIP charges thanks to IPv6.</li>
                    <li><strong>Good Server Performance:</strong> We can choose an EC2 instance type that provides
                        ample resources for a smooth Minecraft experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Minimal Manual Management:</strong> The Discord bot and automated shutdown handle the
                        heavy lifting, freeing us from constant manual intervention.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This cloud-native approach transforms Minecraft server hosting from a fixed-cost burden into an
                    efficient, usage-based model, making it the ideal solution for casual co-op gaming with friends.
                    It's a testament to how intelligent use of cloud services can solve real-world problems with
                    elegance and efficiency.</p>
